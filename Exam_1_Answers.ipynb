Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation).

Mutant plant gynoecia had shorter ovaries and longer gynophores than the wild type, but the total length of the gynoecium is normal before pollination. After pollination, the gynoecium of failed to elongate, resulting in shorter siliques which contained arrested seeds, resulting in lower fertility. The stv1-1 ovules had shorter integuments than wild-type ones, and in some extreme cases, the gametophyte was protruding from the integuments. Mutant plants had defects in vascular system and embryo organization, which are also associated with auxin signaling. Most cotyledons in mutant plants had abnormal vascular patterns that were asymmetric and/or disconnected. Cotyledons were occasionally fused or single, indicating that stv1-1 is associated with defects in embryo patterning. Growth was retarded in both aerial and underground parts of stv1-1 mutants, resulting in plants that were smaller overall than the wild type. In stv1-1 \u001b[01;31m\u001b[Kroots, \u001b[m\u001b[Kgrowth rates were reduced, while leaves were smaller than wild-type ones and pointed. These phenotypic observations suggested that STV1 had pleiotropic effects on whole-plant development in addition to specific effects on organs and tissues affected by known auxin signaling mutations.\t16227452\n",
